# Planning and Preparation for Kubernetes Project

## Introduction
<!-- Brief overview of what this document covers -->
This document details the planning and preparatory steps for setting up a scalable and resilient Kubernetes environment. It covers the allocation of resources, timeline for implementation, risk management strategies, and the technological framework necessary to achieve our project goals.

## Resource Allocation
<!-- Detail the allocation of hardware and human resources -->
### Hardware Allocation
- Distribution of the 5 servers: 1 master node and 4 worker nodes.
- Network hardware setup, including routers, switches, and firewall configurations.

### Team Responsibilities
- Allocation of team members to specific roles: cluster setup, network configuration, CI/CD pipeline setup, etc.

## Timeline
<!-- Provide a timeline for the project -->
- Week 1: Initial setup of servers and network configurations.
- Week 2: Installation of Kubernetes and container runtime.
- Week 3: Configuration of CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Week 4: Deployment of test application and initial testing.

## Risk Management
<!-- Outline potential risks and mitigation strategies -->
- Hardware failure: Ensure backups and redundancy for critical components.
- Network issues: Plan for network testing and have contingency plans for connectivity problems.
- Software compatibility: Verify software versions and dependencies beforehand.

## Technology Stack
<!-- Detail the technology stack including software and tools -->
- Kubernetes version 1.20 or newer for container orchestration.
- Containerd as the container runtime.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.


## Infrastructure Design
<!-- Provide a high-level design of the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure -->
- Diagram of the cluster architecture showing the master and worker nodes.
- Network topology outlining how the nodes will communicate.
- Storage solutions for persistent data storage and backup.

## Preparatory Steps
<!-- List initial steps to prepare for the project execution -->
- Ensure all servers meet the specified hardware requirements.
- Set up a version control system for documentation and code (GitHub repository).
- Prepare an initial setup checklist for the Kubernetes cluster.

<!-- 
End of Planning and Preparation document. This document provides a roadmap for the project execution, ensuring that we have a clear plan to follow and that all team members understand their responsibilities and the project timeline.
