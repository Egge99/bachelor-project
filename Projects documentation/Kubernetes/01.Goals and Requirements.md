# Project Goals and Requirements

## Introduction
<!-- Briefly describe the project, its context, and its importance. -->
The purpose of this project is to create a scalable and resilient Kubernetes environment that can support our application's deployment and operations. This document outlines the specific goals and requirements necessary to achieve this outcome.

## Project Goals
<!-- Define high-level project goals. -->
1. Establish a Kubernetes cluster that is scalable to meet future demands.
2. Ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
3. Automate deployment processes to facilitate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## User Needs
<!-- Detail the needs of the users or stakeholders of the project. -->
- Developers need a reliable environment for deploying and testing applications.
- Operations teams require monitoring and alerting tools to maintain system health.

## System Requirements
<!-- List the technical specifications and requirements for the project. -->
### Hardware Requirements
- A minimum of 5 servers, each with at least 16GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, and 256GB of storage.

### Software Requirements
- Kubernetes version  or newer.
- Compatible container runtime: containerd.
- CI/CD tooling: Github Actions.

### Network Requirements
- High-speed network connectivity between nodes.
- Configured firewall rules to allow necessary intra-cluster communication.

## Constraints
<!-- Outline any limitations or constraints the project must work within. -->
- The project must be completed within a 2-week timeframe.

## Success Criteria
<!-- Define what success looks like for this project. -->
- A fully functional Kubernetes cluster deployed and operational.
- Deployment of a test application demonstrating CI/CD pipeline functionality.
- Documentation of system architecture and operational procedures.
